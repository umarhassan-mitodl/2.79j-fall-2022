  caption: "Scanning electron micrographs of biomaterials employed as scaffolds for\
    \ tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. (Left) A porous collagen-glycosaminoglycan\
    \ sponge-like scaffold; for select applications (viz., defects in the dermis of\
    \ the skin) the sponge-like biomaterial alone can serve as an implantable medical\
    \ device to facilitate the regeneration of the tissue. (Courtesy of Prof. Ioannis\
    \ Yannas.) (Right) A natural bone mineral scaffold produced by removing the organic\
    \ matter from bovine bone; the native collagen fibril structure (diameter and\
    \ periodic pattern) is reflected in the organization of the apatite crystallite\
    \ structure. \_The natural bone mineral matrix is used in the clinic to facilitate\
    \ bone regeneration in defects in various locations, including the mandible and\
    \ maxilla to enable insertion of dental implants. (Courtesy of Prof. Myron Spector.)"
